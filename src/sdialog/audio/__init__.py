"""
This module provides comprehensive functionality for generating audio from text utterances in dialogues.

The audio module extends the core sdialog functionality by adding:

  - Audio generation from text using various TTS engines (Kokoro, IndexTTS)
  - Voice databases with speaker characteristics (gender, age, language)
  - Room acoustics simulation for realistic audio environments
  - Audio dialogue processing with turn-based audio generation
  - Integration with external audio processing libraries (pyroomacoustics, scaper)

Key Components:

  - AudioDialog: Extended dialogue class with audio turn support
  - AudioTurn: Individual dialogue turns with associated audio data
  - BaseTTS: Abstract base class for text-to-speech engines
  - BaseVoiceDatabase: Voice database management with speaker characteristics
  - Room: 3D room specification for acoustics simulation
  - AcousticsSimulator: Room acoustics simulation engine

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sdialog.audio import AudioDialog, KokoroTTS, HuggingfaceVoiceDatabase
        from sdialog.audio.room import Room

        # Create TTS engine and voice database
        tts = KokoroTTS(lang_code="a")  # American English
        voice_db = HuggingfaceVoiceDatabase("sdialog/voices-libritts")

        # Convert regular dialog to audio dialog
        audio_dialog = AudioDialog.from_dialog(dialog)

        # Generate audio for all utterances
        audio_dialog = generate_utterances_audios(
            dialog=audio_dialog,
            voice_database=voice_db,
            tts_pipeline=tts,
            seed=42
        )

        # Simulate room acoustics
        room = Room(dimensions=(5.0, 4.0, 3.0))
        audio_dialog = generate_audio_room_accoustic(
            dialog=audio_dialog,
            room=room,
            dialog_directory="output",
            room_name="living_room"
        )
