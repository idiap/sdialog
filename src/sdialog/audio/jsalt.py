"""
This module provides specialized room generation for medical environments.

The module includes the MedicalRoomGenerator class that creates realistic
medical room configurations with appropriate dimensions, furniture placement,
and acoustic properties. It supports various medical room types including
consultation rooms, examination rooms, treatment rooms, and surgical suites.

Key Features:

  - Medical room type definitions with standardized dimensions
  - Realistic furniture placement for medical environments
  - Aspect ratio calculations for proper room proportions
  - Support for various medical room configurations
  - Integration with room acoustics simulation

Medical Room Types:

  - Consultation: Small consultation rooms (4.5m²)
  - Examination: Standard examination rooms (6m²)
  - Treatment: Treatment rooms (8m²)
  - Patient Room: Patient rooms (9.5m²)
  - Surgery: Operating rooms (12m²)
  - Waiting: Waiting rooms (15m²)
  - Emergency: Emergency rooms (18m²)
  - Office: Medical offices (20m²)

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sdialog.audio.jsalt import MedicalRoomGenerator, RoomRole

        # Create medical room generator
        generator = MedicalRoomGenerator()

        # Generate examination room
        room = generator.generate(args={"room_type": RoomRole.EXAMINATION})

        # Generate random medical room
        random_room = generator.generate(args={"room_type": "random"})
