"""
This module provides base classes for room generation in the sdialog library.

The module includes abstract and concrete room generator classes that create
realistic room configurations with appropriate dimensions, furniture placement,
and acoustic properties. It provides a flexible framework for generating
various types of rooms for audio simulation.

Key Components:

  - RoomGenerator: Abstract base class for room generation
  - BasicRoomGenerator: Concrete implementation for basic room generation
  - Support for customizable room dimensions and furniture placement
  - Integration with room acoustics simulation

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sdialog.audio.room_generator import BasicRoomGenerator

        # Create basic room generator
        generator = BasicRoomGenerator()

        # Generate a room with specified floor area
        room = generator.generate(args={"room_size": 20.0})
