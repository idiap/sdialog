room acoustics simulation, and voice database management. These utilities provide
standardized data structures and helper functions for audio-related operations.

Key Components:

  - RGBAColor: Color enumeration for visual representations
  - Furniture: 3D furniture model for room simulation
  - BodyPosture: Body posture height constants
  - WallMaterial, FloorMaterial, CeilingMaterial: Material enums for acoustics
  - SourceType, SpeakerSide: Audio source and speaker positioning enums
  - SourceVolume: Audio volume level enumeration

  - RoomMaterials: Room material configuration model
  - Role: Speaker role enumeration

Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sdialog.audio.utils import RGBAColor, Furniture, AudioUtils

        # Create furniture for room simulation
        chair = Furniture(
