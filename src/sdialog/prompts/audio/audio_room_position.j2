Your task is to rewrite the following dialogue by adding position attributes to each audio turn to simulate an examination room environment.

Both the `DOCTOR` and `PATIENT` audio turns need to be attributed with a `position` attribute.

Select a plausible value for each attribute from the lists below based on the context of the dialogue:

**Doctor Positions:**
- `at_desk_sitting`
- `next_to_bench_standing`
- `next_to_sink_front`
- `next_to_sink_back`
- `next_to_cupboard_front`
- `next_to_cupboard_back`
- `next_to_door_standing`
- `at_desk_side_standing`

**Patient Positions:**
- `at_door_standing`
- `next_to_desk_sitting`
- `next_to_desk_standing`
- `sitting_on_bench`
- `center_room_standing`

The audio dialogue content, speakers, and order must remain exactly the same. You should only add the position attribute to each audio audio turn.

Here is the original audio dialogue:

Return the modified audio dialogue with the `position` attribute from the AudioTurn filled up.
