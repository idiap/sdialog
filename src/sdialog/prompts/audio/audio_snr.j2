Your task is to rewrite the following dialogue by adding a quantitative Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) attribute to each audio turn.

The `snr` attribute should be a numerical integer representing decibels (dB) that estimates the audio quality based on the conversational context. Assign a value from the following ranges:

- **Quiet Environment (e.g., a library, a private office):** Assign an SNR value between **25 and 35**.
- **Medium Noise Environment (e.g., a typical office, a quiet cafe):** Assign an SNR value between **10 and 20**.
- **Loud Environment (e.g., a busy street, a construction site, a crowded bar):** Assign an SNR value between **0 and 10**.

The dialogue content, speakers, and order must remain exactly the same. You should only add the `snr` attribute to each audio turn.

Here is the original dialogue:

Return the modified audio dialogue with the `snr` attribute from the AudioTurn filled up.
