I've called multiple times, I've explained the issue repeatedly, and I'm sick and tired of getting the runaround. I want this resolved right now. Not tomorrow, not next week, but right now. I either want a working product sent to me immediately or a full refund. And I mean full - including any shipping costs I paid. \n\nThis whole experience has been a complete waste of my time and money. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to buy something, wait for it to arrive, only to find out it doesn't work, and then spend days trying to get help? I'm at my wit's end here!"

I sincerely apologize on behalf of our company.\n\nThank you for providing your email. I've located your order, and I can see the history of your calls. I want you to know that I completely understand your frustration, and I'm going to take care of this for you right now.\n\nGiven the difficulties you've faced, I'd like to offer you two options:\n\n1. I can process a full refund right away, including all shipping costs. This refund will be initiated immediately, and you should see it reflected in your account within 3-5 business days.\n\n2. I can arrange for a replacement product to be shipped to you via express delivery at no additional cost. We'll also include a return label for the defective product.\n\nAdditionally, as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience you've experienced, I'd like to offer you a 20% discount on your next purchase with us.\n\nWhich option would you prefer, Mr. Smith? I'm ready to process whichever you choose right away. Again, I sincerely apologize for your negative experience, and I appreciate your patience.
