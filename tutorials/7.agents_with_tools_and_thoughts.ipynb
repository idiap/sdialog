Also, need to remember to verify identity later, but not right away. Maybe start with \"Good afternoon!

      "\u001b[31m[AGENT] \u001b[95m(thinking) Okay, the user is calling about their Viper 3000 modem that stopped working. They need it resolved immediately. First, I should acknowledge their urgency. Since I'm a customer support agent with expertise in software subscriptions and account management, but the modem is a hardware issue. My product scope doesn't include hardware troubleshooting, but maybe I can guide them through some initial steps. Wait, the escalation policy says to escalate if there's a high-severity technical failure. The user mentioned it stopped working, which might be a technical issue. However, my resolution authority is to handle most issues independently. But since the modem is hardware, maybe I need to check if there's a known issue or if they need to contact hardware support. However, the user might expect me to help. Let me verify if there's a software-related fix first. Maybe a firmware update or a configuration issue. I should ask them to check the connection, restart the modem, and see if there are any error messages. If those steps don't work, then I might need to escalate to a senior agent or hardware support. But according to the persona, I can resolve most issues independently. Wait, but the product scope is software subscriptions, account management, billing. Hardware issues might not be within my scope. Hmm, need to be careful here. Let me check the product_scope again. It says software subscriptions, account management, billing issues. So the modem is a hardware device. Therefore, I might not have the authority to resolve it. But the user is expecting support. Maybe I should guide them through basic troubleshooting steps and then escalate if needed. The rules say to make sure to let the customer know next actions and verify identity. So first, I should ask for their account details to verify identity, then proceed with troubleshooting steps. If those steps don't work, then escalate. But the user said \"immediately,\" so I need to act quickly. Let me structure the response: apologize for the inconvenience, ask for verification, then guide them through steps. If they can't resolve it, then escalate. But according to the persona, I can resolve most issues independently. However, hardware issues might be outside my scope. Need to make sure I follow the escalation policy. Let me check the escalation policy again: escalate if legal concerns, unresolved billing disputes, or high-severity technical failures. The modem failure might be a high-severity technical failure. Therefore, I should escalate to a senior agent. But the user might not know that. So the steps would be: verify identity, check basic troubleshooting, if no luck, escalate. But the user wants immediate resolution. Maybe I should inform them that I can escalate to a senior agent who can handle hardware issues. Let me put that together. \u001b[0m\n",

Then, check the modem status with the provided details. Since the user mentioned it's a Platinum account and wants expedited help, Jordan should prioritize this. But according to the tools, the check_modem_status function requires customer_id, model, and serial. The user provided all three, so Jordan can call that function next.

The note says no heartbeat for over 48 hours, likely a power supply failure or dead device. Since the user mentioned needing immediate resolution, I should consider the best course of action. The options are shipping a replacement modem or scheduling a technician. Given that the modem isn't receiving power, it might be a hardware issue. Platinum customers usually get priority, so shipping a replacement quickly would be efficient. I should check if the user prefers a replacement or on-site service. But since the modem isn't powering on, it's probably best to ship a new one. I'll need the user's address for shipping. Also, I should confirm if they want to proceed with that or if they prefer a technician. Wait, the user hasn't provided their address yet. I need to ask for that.

They mentioned it's causing delays at work and expect better service due to their Platinum status. Let me see what options I have. First, I need to check if there's a way to expedite the shipment further. The previous response mentioned scheduling the replacement with high priority, but maybe there's an even faster option. The tools available include shipping a replacement modem, but the function parameters don't specify different shipping speeds. However, since the user is Platinum, perhaps I can override the standard shipping time. Wait, the ship_replacement_modem function's parameters are customer_id, model, and address. There's no mention of shipping speed in the function's arguments. But the user's Platinum status might allow for next-day or same-day shipping. Maybe I can contact the shipping department manually, but the tools don't have a function for that. Alternatively, maybe escalate the ticket to get faster handling. Looking at the escalation_policy, it says to escalate if there's a high-severity technical failure. The modem is not working, which is critical. So I should escalate the ticket to a senior agent to get it prioritized. Also, the user's Platinum status should be considered for faster resolution. I should call the escalate_ticket function with severity P1 and note the Platinum status and urgency. Then, maybe after escalation, the senior agent can handle the shipping request with higher priority. Also, I should inform the user that I'm escalating and provide a ticket ID for reference. But the user might need a quicker response. Let me make sure to use the escalate_ticket function with the right parameters. The customer ID is 12345, severity should be P1, and the notes should mention the Platinum account and the need for same-day shipping. That way, the senior agent can intervene and possibly arrange for urgent shipping. \u001b[0m\n",
